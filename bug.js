In React Router Dom v6,  using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route's path can lead to unexpected behavior.  If the parent component is re-rendered, `useParams` might not correctly update with the latest route parameters. This is because `useParams` relies on the route context, and that context might be lost during re-renders if the component is not directly connected to the route.  For instance, you might see stale parameter values even after navigation.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage
function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  // ... component logic ...
}

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

<Route path="/:id" element={<ParentComponent />}>
```
