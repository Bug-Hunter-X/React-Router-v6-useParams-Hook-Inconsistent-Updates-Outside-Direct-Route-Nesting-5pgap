To solve this, ensure that the component using `useParams` is directly nested within a route's element. If you can't restructure your components, consider lifting the state that depends on the parameters to a higher level that is within the route's scope.

```javascript
//Correct Usage
function MyComponent({id}) {
  // ... component logic using 'id'...
}

function ParentComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent id={id}/>
    </div>
  );
}

<Route path="/:id" element={<ParentComponent />}>
```
This revised code directly uses `useParams` within `ParentComponent`, which is nested inside the route.  The `id` value is then passed down as a prop to `MyComponent`, ensuring that the component always has access to the correct, updated parameter.
